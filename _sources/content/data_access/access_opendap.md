Accessing the OPeNDAP Server
===

##  What is OPeNDAP
OPeNDAP, short for "Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol," is a notable member among the array of "data access protocols" (such as HTTP or FTP) commonly employed to access datasets, particularly in the realm of Earth and environmental sciences. It is also adaptable for use in diverse domains beyond this scope. As its name implies, OPeNDAP is an open-source solution, which means it is freely available for deployment and use.

One of OPeNDAP's key advantages lies in its ability to perform on-the-fly data transfer or to subset datasets. This flexibility ensures that it can effectively cater to the diverse needs of different users, enhancing accessibility and usability.

Typically, a data server, such as a THREDDS server (Thematic Real-time Environmental Data Distribution System server), is equipped with the capability to provide various data access protocols, including OPeNDAP. This versatility allows users to select the most suitable access method for their requirements.
