CEFI data

## CEFI data 
CEFI data is currently available through the PSL CEFI portal, supported by the PSL Thredds server. We are testing a cloud solution provided by NOAA NODD, and once it becomes available, we will begin creating a related access tutorial in this section. 

## CEFI portal data access
The CEFI portal currently provides three ways to [access data](https://psl.noaa.gov/cefi_portal/#data_access), including:
- Direct [Thredds server catalog access](https://psl.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/Projects/CEFI/regional_mom6/catalog.html)
- A list of variables in diffenrent formats (including HTML, JSON, and XML) 
- A data query generator that creates URLs, code snippets, download links, and data citation information
These three methods aim to meet a wide range of data needs for the public and researchers. Users are encouraged to explore the different options and choose the method that is most familiar and easy for them to use.
