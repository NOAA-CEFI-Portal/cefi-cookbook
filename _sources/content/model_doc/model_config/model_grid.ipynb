    "````{dropdown} What is Arakawa C Grid? (optional read)\n",
    "The Arakawa grid system, including the C-grid, was introduced by Arakawa and Lamb in 1971.\n",
    "The “staggered” Arakawa C-grid is named so because it further separates the evaluation of vector quantities compared to the Arakawa B-grid. For instance, instead of evaluating both east-west (u) and north-south (v) velocity components at the grid center, the C-grid evaluates the u components at the centers of the left and right grid faces, and the v components at the centers of the upper and lower grid faces1.\n",
    "This staggering of variables is employed to retain non-divergence of the flow at all times2. The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), for example, uses the Arakawa Staggered C-Grid in its atmospheric calculations. This staggering allows for more accurate representation and computation of physical quantities in numerical models.\n",

    "If you have netcdf4 package installed in you local system, `ncdump -hs ocean_static.nc` also shows the same information directly in the Command Line Interface.\n",

    "- **Scalars** are quantities that are fully described by a magnitude (or numerical value) alone. In this context, they are located at the **T/h-points**.\n",
    "- **Velocities** are vector quantities that are described by both a direction and a magnitude. Here, they are staggered such that **u-points** (representing velocity in the x-direction) and **v-points** (representing velocity in the y-direction) are not at the same location.\n",
    "- **Vorticities**, which measure the spinning motion of fluid particles, are located at **q-points**.\n",

    "The indexing for points (i,j) in the logically-rectangular domain is such that i increases in the x direction (eastward for spherical polar coordinates), and j increases in the y direction (northward for spherical polar coordinates).\n",
    "A q-point with indices (i,j) lies to the upper right (northeast) of the h-point with the same indices. This means that if you have a scalar at a certain point (h-point), the vorticity (q-point) associated with that scalar is located to its upper right.\n",

    "The index for the vertical dimension k increases with depth, although the vertical coordinate z, measured from the mean surface level z=0, decreases with depth. This means that as you go deeper into the fluid, the k index increases, but the z coordinate (measured from the surface) decreases.\n",

    "In the `ocean_static.nc` file, there isn't a vertical coordinate or index. The vertical coordinate that the CEFI data portal provides has been adjusted to a regular z coordinate, which increases with depth. This adjusted coordinate is only present in data with three-dimensional values. The coordinate variables include `z_l`, which represents the depth at the center of a cell, and `z_i`, which represents the depth at the cell interface. In other words, `z_l` and `z_i` are used to denote the depth at different points within the cell structure in the data.\n",
