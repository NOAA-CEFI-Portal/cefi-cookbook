# CEFI Data Portal

![CEFI LOGO](../images/cefi_logo.png)

As part of the Operational Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Decision Support System, CEFI Data Portal's goal is to provide easy access to regional ocean model outputs (high spatial resolution reanalysis, hindcasts, predictions, and projections optimized for management applications), ecosystem projections and other information relevant to climate-informed resource management.
The CEFI data portal is currently hosted at [https://psl.noaa.gov/cefi_portal](https://psl.noaa.gov/cefi_portal). This cookbook is builded based on the [Jupyterbook project](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and aimed to provide valuable information to users of varying expertise levels.
